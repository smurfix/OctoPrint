        **Thank you for wanting to request a feature in OctoPrint!**


        Before you go ahead with your request, please first consider if it wouldn't be
        better suited for a plugin. As a general rule of thumb, any feature that is only
        of interest to a small sub group should be moved into a plugin. Only such features
        that are of interest to a majority of OctoPrint's users will be implemented as
        part of the core itself.
